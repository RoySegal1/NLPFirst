It took 0.08 seconds to Tokenize with nltk
NLTK After Tokenize Statistics:
Total words: 53535
Unique words: 8567
Most common words: [('u', 1192), ('call', 591), ('2', 528), ('get', 391), ('ur', 385)]



It took 5.14 seconds to Tokenize with spacy
Number of Tokens :54222
Number of unique words: 8382
Most 5 :[('u', 1192), ('call', 591), ('2', 528), ('get', 391), ('ur', 385)]

We can see that the time it took spacy to tokenize the data was 64 time slower than NLTK,
the total words and unique words of each implementation is similar.
we observed slight difference in each tokenization process (can't is divided to can,n't in both i've aswell), but co-founded is divided differently


It took 0.77 seconds to Lemmatize in nltk
Nltk After Lemmatization Statistics:
Total words: 8567
Unique words: 8047
Most common words: [('go', 3), ('le', 3), ('slice', 2), ('bus', 2), ('guide', 2)]



It took 0.00 seconds to lemmatize with spaCy
Spacy After Lem Statistics:
Total words: 7451
Unique words: 6353
Most common words: [('go', 6), ('get', 6), ('take', 5), ('know', 5), ('fall', 5)]


this time spaCy was faster then NLK in contrary to the tokenization.
the number of unique words at nltk is larger proportionally to spaCy, 
thus we can deduce that the nltk lemmatizeion process groups less as an example we can see that the word go appears 6 times in spacy and 3 in nltk.



It took 0.08 seconds to Stem in nltk
NLTK in stem Statistics:
Total words: 8567
Unique words: 7244
Most common words: [('hope', 7), ('care', 6), ('use', 5), ('remind', 5), ('predict', 5)]



It took 0.07 seconds to Stem in spacy
Spacy After Stemming Statistics:
Total words: 7451
Unique words: 6133
Most common words: [('hope', 7), ('care', 6), ('like', 5), ('use', 5), ('love', 5)]

the stemming process in both took the same time.
the proportionality between the total words and the unique words is similar in both.
